## About Nameize

### Installation Guide Below
Ever wanted to simply generate a username with little to no hassle? Or maybe you are tired of using the awful username generators on websites.
Nameize is an open-source python project that goes through a list of English words, checks if they are available then checks if they are allowed on roblox.

The bot will give names such as: *unhopefulness, unawardably, conjunctional* (anything in the list of English words that isn't taken and appropriate)
